Endless beaches, timeless ruins, welcoming people, oodles of elephants, rolling surf, cheap prices, fun trains, 
famous tea and flavourful food make Sri Lanka irresistible.You might say Sri Lanka has been hiding in plain sight. 
Scores of travellers have passed overhead on their way to someplace else, but years of uncertainty kept Sri Lanka off 
many itineraries.

Now, however, all that has changed. The country is moving forward quickly as more and more people discover 
its myriad charms. Lying between the more trodden parts of India and Southeast Asia, Sri Lanka's history, 
culture and natural beauty are undeniably alluring. It's the place you haven't been to yet, that you should.

Few places have as many Unesco World Heritage Sites (eight) packed into such a small area. Sri Lanka's 2000-plus years 
of culture can be discovered at ancient sites where legendary temples boast beautiful details even as they shelter in 
caves or perch on prominent peaks. More recent are evocative colonial fortresses, from Galle to Trincomalee.

Across the island, that thing that goes bump in the night might be an elephant heading to a favourite waterhole. 
Safari tours of Sri Lanka’s pleasantly relaxed national parks encounter leopards, water buffaloes, all manner of birds 
and a passel of primates.
